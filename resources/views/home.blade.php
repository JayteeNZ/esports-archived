						It's been 44 days since we announced the release of Parallel. 44 days sounds like a lot
						but in reality, it's flown over for us.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						But we're finally here! But what does that mean now? Well, we're releasing the website
						as a BETA and for the next 8 weeks, we'll continuously roll out updates.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						As of right now, the website is pretty much blank. There's only a handful of actions
						you can do.

						You will however, have the ability to create a basic profile and start participating in Tournaments.

					<h2 class="mb-4">"The 8 week phase"</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						The 8 week phase is where Parallel will truly come to life. It starts now and ends in..... well 8 weeks.
						These 8 weeks will see a large number of improvements, in fact, it'll be like a brand new website you've never
						seen before.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						Here's a few features you'll see soon:
						<ul>
							<li>An improved Tournament system</li>
							<li>Introducing Leagues</li>
							<li>A full-fledged Forum</li>
							<li>Ladders</li>
							<li>A few secret features we haven't discussed</li>
						</ul>

						That isn't all. The list is too long to mention.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						These 8 weeks allows us to monitor our website and ensure that it's where it should be. It also allows us to
						expand our growth, so that when these new systems do come into place, they'll be stable and packed full
						of players.
					</p>

					<h2 class="mb-4">Day One</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 20px">
						Hopefully, our systems work smoothly for day one. We are in BETA, so these things are expected. Thank you for support Parallel and best of luck from hereonin.

						Last but not least - A big thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/RageESC">Rage</a>, our Partner, for supporting us through the development stage.
